Installation Walkthrough
------------------------
1. Install a Linux distribution that supports a Desktop Environment.

2. cd into the directory this archive is cloned or copied into and type the following commands:

```
$ ./autogen.sh
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

3. In the Desktop Environment's Appearance Settings select the icon theme, and apply it. In most cases the icon pack should be fully applied.

4. If the icons haven't changed restart your file manager or logout.

5. Uninstalling these icon themes for now can be done by cding as administrator into the /usr/share/icons directory and searching for folders to delete with the tag _Icons.

Known Issues
------------
1. Packages do not uninstall using sudo make uninstall.
